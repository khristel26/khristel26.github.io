			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p class="text-secondary">I am currently pursuing an MPP degree at the Harris School of Public Policy at The University of Chicago, with over five years of work experience, including four in the social and health public sector. My roles have entailed developing and implementing policies and initiatives aimed at improving the lives of vulnerable populations. In the public sector, I have worked at the Ministry of Women and Vulnerable Populations, as well as the Social Security and Health Insurance Program, EsSalud. </p>
			<p class="text-secondary">Additionally, I have served as a research assistant at the Behavioral Insights and Parenting Lab and worked as a graduate intern at the Regional Service Center for Africa - UNDP in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. I also have teaching experience, having worked as a Teaching Assistant for both undergraduate courses at Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru and graduate courses at Harris School of Public Policy. Aside from my work experience, I have also volunteered as an electoral observer and founded a student magazine at my undergraduate university.
			</p>
			<p class="text-secondary">I have been honored to receive several awards, including the Fulbright Scholar Irving B. Harris Fellowship, DKG World Fellowship, P.E.O International Peace Scholarship, and the Peruvian Government Bicentennial Generation Scholarship. In 2015, I was selected for a scholarship to study at Johannes Kepler University in Austria for one semester. Additionally, I was selected by the Botin Foundation from 6,000 candidates for an intensive academic program conducted in Spain and Brazil. In 2019, I participated in the Young Latin American Leaders Program, a leadership and academic training program held in Spain and Belgium.
			</p>
			<p class="text-secondary">Furthermore, I have attended courses and conferences in countries such as Australia, the USA, and Colombia. I received my B.A. in Management from Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru on a full-ride scholarship, which is granted only to a select group of prominent Peruvian high school students.
